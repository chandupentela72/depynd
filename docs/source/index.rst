:py:mod:`depynd` - evaluating dependencies among random variables
=================================================================
:py:mod:`depynd` is a Python library for evaluating dependencies among random variables from data. It supports learning
statistical dependencies for one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships, where each one corresponds to

- mutual information (MI) estimation,
- feature selection, and
- graphical model structure learning,

respectively. Specifically, :py:mod:`depynd` supports MI estimation for discrete-continuous mixtures, MI-based feature selection,
and structure learning of undirected graphical models (a.k.a. Markov random fields).
